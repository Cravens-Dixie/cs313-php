                   <p> This where I spend my mornings. I walk, think, pray, and get ready for the day
                       in these woods. Oh, and I walk the dog too.

                   <p> East TN isn't the best place for fruit trees...too wet. So finding this old apple tree was like
                       finding hidden treasure!
                   </p>
                   <p>By April East TN was green and in bloom. So were the ticks, unfortunately.

                   <p> "Too close to OakRidge" is the local joke whenever you see something a "little" different in nature.
                       I laughed at this flower for several weeks. It needs a good meme...something about being who you are,
                       even if that is a 4-headed daisy in a patch of 1-headed daisies. The fields that surround the woods
                       are full of little surprises and wonders for those that pay attention.

                   <p> The fall of 2019 was the earliest snow-on-the-ground that I have experienced in Tennessee.
                       I've lived here for 31 years! Fortunately it was the perfect snow for East TN...beautiful
                       and melted off the roads by late afternoon. Louie and I enjoyed our snowy walk.
                       No need to run the city's one snow plow down our hilly road.
                   </p>
                   <p>Notice the leaves. I've never seen snow and fall leaves before. Picture taken November 12, 2019

                   <p> Father's day weekend was surprisingly cold. We were camping in Treemont so we could see the (end)
                       of the synchronous firefly show. (This happens in only two places...the Smoky Mountains and somewhere
                       in China.) We knew it was going to be cool...in the valley. We froze in the mountains. You might call
                       us city-slickers because we forgot to adjust for 10+ degrees cooler temps in the National Park. Worth it!
                   </p>
                   <p>There are fireflies in here...maybe. Picture taken June 13, 2019
